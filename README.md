## 500png optimization challenge

# Framer motion
In the framer-motion branch you can find an implementation made with framer motion, i have tried to optimize the bundle size and load times but find that this way was very unperformant no matter what

# CSS implementation
In second place i have tried to implement the animations with CSS, finally end using css variables to randomize the animation, found that this way is more performant but also harder to make the animation you want to do.

Any feedback is welcome!
